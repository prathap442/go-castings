# CaseSensitivity
- Go is case sensitive
# Static or dynamically Typed?
- Go is the statically typed language since there goes on declaration of the datatype inthe variable intiailization 
# Declaring variables in go
```
 var decksize string = "twenty four"

```
 This is the process of declaring the variables in the go and in the go if we look into the segregating first comes the type of the variable, variable name, datatype

 and go has got the intellisense to itself to identify the what kind of variable should it be of when we are tired of declaring the data types in the statically and the dynamically typed languages and then

 ```
  var decksize string = "52 cards"
  // the above statement can equivalently be written as 
```

```
  decksize := "52 cards"
  // go lang has got the intellignce to identity what kind of the variable is it from the assignmet data .
 ```
